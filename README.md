# CaaS
CaaS - Consistency as a Service.
This is my Major Project in my Bachelors.
I wanted to work on this Project because ,

  1st - It is based on Cloud.
  
  II - I always loved to work on it.

In this Project we basically built a system to know the Consistency of a File uploaded to the Cloud.
So that the user knows the what is happening behind the scene.

The Idea is to maintain a consistency of the file across the Cloud so that the user can know the "RealTime Status" of the file.
That has been uploaded to the Cloud.
On the process of uploading the code to "Azure" Website...
Will be updating this file ASAP.
